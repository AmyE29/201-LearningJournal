## JS Error Handling and Debugging

A good way to find where your errors are in your javascript code is to look in the console.
Some types of errors you will find there are:
- SyntaxError
- ReferenceError
- TypeError
- RangeError
- URIError
- EvalError


To debug your code you need to 
 1. Find out where the problem is
 2. What the problem is

The console will help you narrow this down.
Logging your code to the console
  
    console.log()

will help your see if your code is working too.
