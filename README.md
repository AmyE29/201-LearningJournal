### Writing Links

The differnt types of links you can add to your HTML page are
- external links
- internal links
- links that open new windows, called target links
- links that open an email program to email a specific address
- links that refer to other parts of your own page
All links are created by using the <a> element.

<b>External links are made by:</b>

    <a href= "http://www.webpage.com">Web Page</a>
  
<b>Internal links are made by:</b>

    <a href= "about.html">About Us</a> 
    
<b>Links that open new windows are made by:</b>

    <a href= "http://www.website.com" target="_blank"> Website</a>
    
<b>Email links are made by:</b>  

    <a href= "mailto:me@email.com">Email Me</a>
    
<b>Links to parts of your page are made by:</b>

    <a href= "#about>About Us</a>
    <h2 id ="about">About Us</h2>
    
    
 ### Controlling the position of elements
 Some important css properties to remember when trying to position text or images on a page are:
 - position: static
 - position: relative
 - position: absoulte
 - position: fixed
 - z-index
 - float
 
 I wish I had read this chapter before I submitted my last lab assignment.  I probably could have fixed some of my layout problems.
 
### Functions
Functions let you group a statements together to preform one task. When you ask your function to preform a task it is called ***calling the function***.  Information that is given to a function to complete the task is called the ***parameters***. When the function gives you an output, it is called the ***return value***.

To declare a funtion you:

    function functionName() {
        document.write ('Put some text here')
    }
    
### Pair Programming
Paired progamming is an agile practice, where you work with a partner in coding. This helps you to:
- complete assignments
- learn how to better communicate
- learn from your partner, learn differnt techniques
- be prepared for interviews
- be ready for working at a company that uses these practices
