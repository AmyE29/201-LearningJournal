## CSS Review

I learned more about positioning of elements on the page
  
   position: static
   position: relative
   postion: absolute
   position: fixed
   z-index
   float
   
I had known about positioning before, but I wasn't really aware of what each one actually did.  Now I feel like I have a better grasp on layout.
