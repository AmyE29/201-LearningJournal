## Flash Video
Flash is a popular way for adding animations, video and audio to your websites.
It can be emdeebed in your HTML with <object> and <embed> tags, but it's more common to use JavaScript.
When Flash was first released I used it to create animations on websites, it was super cool but super heavy and made websites load very slowly.
