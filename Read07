## HTML Tables
A table places information in a grid pattern, each block on the grid is called a <b>table cell.</b>
The basic structure of a table is
  
  <table>
    <tr>
      indicates the start of each row
        <td>
         contains the table data
        </td>
    </tr>
 </table>
 
 <th> tags are used to give your table headings
 You can use "rowspan=" or "colspan=" to to change the width and height of your cells to make the data span over more than one row or column.
